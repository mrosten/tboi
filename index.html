            <h2>Dedication</h2>
            <p>Dedicated to my parents <strong>Philip</strong> and <strong>Leila Rosenblum</strong>, the greatest,
                wisest people I have ever known, and my children.</p>

            <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
            <p>Acknowledgements to my son Moshe who put his time, sweat and tears into this book. Much of this book
                consists of discussions I have had with him and my son, Nachman Isaac. To my brothers David and Keith
                who have stood with me all the years through thick and thin. They are the greatest brothers one could
                have.</p>
            <p>I did not originate the idea of using physics to explain the Torah. I got it from the book <em>Genesis
                    and the Big Bang</em>.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <blockquote>
                "By belief in the wise, we are able to bring our judgement to light. By belief in the wise of all the
                generations, one can find the right advice for all his situations."
                <cite>— Rabbi Nachman of Breslov</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
                "Nothing in this world is so powerful, as an idea whose time has come."
                <cite>— Victor Hugo</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <p>It is my hope that this book will show the higher root of philosophy and science and provide a basis for
                one unified system of science, philosophy, and Kabbalah.</p>

            <p>The world is a symphony made of different instruments all playing different parts of the song that only
                God can hear. This symphony is "the revelation of the Oneness of God", and the evil and cruel contribute
                just as much to it as the righteous and brave — for in the end darkness and evil will disappear by the
                light and by their disappearance God will be magnified just as much as the salvation of the good and
                just.</p>

            <p>This applies to every person just as much as in the world at large — for in every person the good essence
                in every person will rise and be grafted into the holy light and the evil will fall away and vanish
                forever as the shadows before the light.</p>

            <p>The root and basis of my path is faith — faith in all the wise men of history, and especially the Sages
                of Israel. It is the conflicts between the sages themselves which force me to formulate a theory
                consistent with the Gemara and the later Sages as well as with history and the plain facts of science.
                It just happened that in the course of my studies I noticed many connections between systems that were
                considered to be contradictory, and many times I noticed how the questions that one system couldn't
                answer were answered by another. So, I decided that, perhaps, there really is no contradiction, and
                there is really only one great system. So here is my attempt to formulate it.</p>

            <p>My motivation in writing this book was to give myself a reference book, to help me evaluate any new ideas
                or issues that come up, and see how they fit in the general scheme of things. My hope is that this will
                be a help for others also.</p>
