“Life without pleasure is impossible.” – Thomas Aquinas

Happiness is the result of motion upward or inward, which depends on one's upward or inward energy. Some people have only upward energy, and some have energy that drives them inward. But there is a law of conservation of energy which results in the law of conservation of happiness. Only a certain amount of happiness is granted to one. But by association with others, one reaches a state of equilibrium with them. If they are unhappy then eventually one’s happiness gets dissipated by them. But by prayer, learning Torah and Wisdom, and kindness you can draw more from God (but you can't create it yourself). Each of these (or any service connected with the ten Divine sephirot), draws with it, when done in connection with God, a certain light and happiness related to its own sepherah and also brings with it a special physical blessing, e.g., kindness brings love into one's life, sexual purity brings sex (i.e. not to have sex in a wrong way tends to bring sex in the right way). A result of this law is that great pleasure and great pain always come together so that the equilibrium will be preserved. An example of this is the Kennedy family.

There is another conservation law of spiritual energy, that if you spend it on one thing you won't have it for something else; so, choose wisely. Try to spend it on things that will draw further energy from the Source, i.e., good deeds. [Using one's spiritual energy is what Rabbi Nachman means by praying with strength. Yet, because of the law of conservation of spiritual energy, one should be careful how he uses it and conserve it for important things and not use it all up on small things].

Rabbi Nachman says that it is always an important commandment to be happy [in God]. So, if you have a doubt about if you should do something or not, i.e., if it's God's will or not, then look at the happiness factor. If it's there, then it's God's will. [I think that the translation from Rabbi Nachman's Yiddish into the Hebrew aphorism that “It is a great mitzvah to be happy always”, is a mistranslation for there is no such mitzvah. Rather he meant, “It is always a great mitzvah to be happy”- i.e., to be happy and rejoice in the Lord.

The Gemarah in Avoda Zara asks on the contradiction between the verses in Kohelet, where King Solomon praises happiness in one and puts it down in the other… It answers that happiness in God is a good thing, happiness not in God is not. The reason for this is that happiness is klipat noga [the tree of knowledge of good and evil], so when it is in God it becomes included in holiness and the bad in it falls away. But depression is from the three totally evil klipot. Therefore any depression is evil.

Now you could ask about Mozart and Beethoven or artists in general where it seems a bit of unhappiness stirred and inspired their best creations. On one level you can answer that their experiences were unhappy, not their attitude. Also, Rabbi Shneur Zalman explained that judgements come from a higher source than blessings so when one stays attached to God in the long run the judgements turn into the highest blessings.

“Nothing that is vast enters into the life of mortals without a curse.” -Sophocles.

Heisenberg was embarrassed at his oral exam for his P.H.D. when he didn't know how to work out the resolution of a microscope, and he had to go and re-learn it. When the next year he developed Matrix Mechanics [or quantum mechanics] the subject of resolution became a powerful tool to show the truth of the uncertainty principle.

There was a young woman accused of communists ties and her reputation ruined and almost lost her job. She went to the president of the company to ask him to stick up for her. He took an interest in her and besides helping her keep her job he married her. She became the first lady of the USA, the wife of President George Bush.
