There is the sine function for the day, week, month, year, life. There is in every person's life one peak. After that they waste the rest of their lives trying to get it back. Nothing leads to as much unhappiness as the pursuit of happiness.

True Enlightenment comes only once in a lifetime. As we see with Jacob that first he had a great revelation from God and a great promise on his way to Laban. Then on his way back he had to fight with God [i.e., God revealed himself again to Jacob, but this time as a man and as an enemy.] And then he had years of trouble in Israel. After that he only had years of peace in Egypt. For this world is only a preparation for the next. Here one must suffer the love and wrath of God, and only then one can become a man.
