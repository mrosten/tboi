<strong>Valid Approaches to Studying Talmud</strong>
There are different ways to understand the Talmud. There is the way of looking to be strict and the way of looking to be lenient. Both are valid (i.e., some people learn to find ways of being stricter and some to be less strict — and both are valid because as the Talmud says, “God said to do, so no matter how we do it, it’s ok with Him” — as long as one is trying to do the right thing).

Other valid paths include:
<ul>
<li><strong>Deep Logic:</strong> Penetrating the infinite logic of the Gemarah (and Rashi/Tosafot).</li>
<li><strong>Breadth:</strong> Covering the length and breadth as the commentaries tend to do.</li>
<li><strong>Kabbalistic:</strong> Understanding the mystical underpinnings.</li>
<li><strong>Halachic:</strong> The practical application (split between the Rambam's unified view and those who see local variations).</li>
<li><strong>Deep Principles:</strong> The method of Reb Chaim to find underlying abstract principles.</li>
</ul>

I had my own way for a while to find all the conflicting principles in every subject and reduce them down to one final principle, but I never finished it. My model of the Gemarah is not open from the outside (like the non-religious), but open from the inside, — i.e., to go into the deeper dimensions. So instead of the flat way, I want to open up the 4th dimension of the Talmud so that everything it says should be invariant only if you look at it from the spiritual way, not the flat way.

The Oral Law was written down during the second Temple period in documents of the Scribes (professional rabbis), the ultra-orthodox (the Prushim) and the Essenes. After the destruction of the Temple, the long arduous process of collecting, sorting out and arranging the discussions and decisions in the countless documents and oral traditions before the Yeshivot in Babylon and Israel began. The Talmud is a work of the genius of many generations after the destruction, compiling and evaluating the laws handed down by those groups.

Therefore, the Talmud itself doesn't present a question on Jesus since it was meant to collect the traditions at the time of its writing and not as Divine knowledge. It is a work of genius, but it is still influenced by the time period it was created which was extremely isolationist in its point of view because of the Bar Kochba incident. The purpose in the stories is, as all the history written at that time, meant to instruct values and morals, not as historical facts.

The Oral Law Torah existed as documents that the Pharisees, Scribes, and Essences had in written form [as seen in the tractates of the scribes and in the Dead Sea scrolls, which represent a body of writings from all the Jewish groups that lived then including the Jews that believed in Jesus. However, those writings have been suppressed by the Catholic Church since they contradict their ideas which are based on Paul].

The Rambam held openly that the only part of the Talmud that is actually a direct tradition from Mount Sinai are the parts where the Gemarah says or assumes that something is Biblical law. The Kabbalah says the Gemarah is from **Royalty of Emanation** which means it came from a flow of wisdom from that sepherah like Newton received a flow of wisdom from the realm of Math and Physics -- That doesn't imply infallibility. History bears this out for we find many sources of the Braitot are actually from the Essenes who had a totally different world view from the Pharisees (the orthodox at time of the second Temple) and later from the Talmud itself. The dead sea scrolls clearly bear out the fact that the Gemarah is exactly what it claims to be, a compilation and evaluation of the millions of Braitot floating around during the Second Temple period. Evaluating the Talmud from the historical context it came in tends to take out its mythical dimensions but if done with care and respect it shows its true greatness.
