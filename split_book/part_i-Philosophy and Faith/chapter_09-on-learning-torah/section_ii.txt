One class from each one of the main four categories should be learned each day. For instance: learn the Bible, then a class in halachah, then one in Talmud or science, and then one in Kabbalah.

The Books which come from Beauty of Atzilut are Sipurai Maasiot [Crown], Tanya [Wisdom], Noam Elimelech [Understanding], Likutai Moharan, Sefer HaMidot [six middle sephirot] [Malchut]. [This is only to the Rambam and Chovot Halevavot]

This next diagram is a close up of physicality of beauty (zeir anpin):

<strong>Sephirot Mapping: Zeir Anpin</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>c (Crown):</strong> The root of the five books of Moses.</li>
<li><strong>w (Wisdom):</strong></li>
<li><strong>u (Understanding):</strong></li>
<li><strong>k (Kindness):</strong></li>
<li><strong>p (Power):</strong></li>
<li><strong>b (Beauty):</strong></li>
<li><strong>v (Victory):</strong></li>
<li><strong>s (Splendor):</strong></li>
<li><strong>f (Foundation):</strong></li>
</ul>
In these right and left hand sephirot are located the roots of the prophets. In those middle three sephirot are located the roots of the sacred writings [like the psalms proverbs, etc].

The next diagram is a closeup of Formation of Royalty.

The middle three “pbk” [power, beauty, kindness] are the root of the three parts of the Mishna <em>Seeds</em>, <em>Times</em> and <em>Women</em>. The lower three are the roots of the three other parts <em>Damages</em>, <em>Sacrifices</em>, and <em>Purity</em>.

By learning the mishnayot <em>Seeds</em> one draws the light of the name <strong>mlp la pla</strong> from the top four vessels into the vessel of kindness. By learning tractate <em>Times</em>, one draws from the light of the name <strong>myhla</strong> into the vessel of Power. The tractate <em>Women</em> draw the light of the name <strong>tvabe</strong> into the vessels of Beauty. By learning <em>Damages</em>, one draws the light of the name <strong>laa</strong> into the vessel of Victory. Learning the tractate <em>Sacrifices</em> one draws the light of the name <strong>myhla yhla hla laa</strong> into the vessel of Splendor. <em>Purity</em> draws the light of <strong>yds</strong> into the vessel of Foundation.

So, the entire Talmud is only the Talmud of the Nefesh [lowest level of the soul], not the spirit or the soul. The reason the Talmud is incomplete is that the souls of the Amoraim [rabbis of the Talmud] were from Beauty of Emanation...
