Today, it is actually possible to test the validity of many statements of the Sages, for they make empirically verifiable claims, i.e., certain actions causally precede certain results. With today's methods of statistical analysis, it would be a simple matter to conduct research on such issues.

I believe that religion actually has little effect on one's character – and that is even if the power of one's faith is real and sincere. The Bible is only a tool for those who want to improve. It is a guide, or map, for one's improvement in many regards, but it is not a bus to take you there.

The characters of good and evil are real, and religion has no effect on them. In fact, while giving those who want to be good a way to do so, it also gives those who want to simply make money, also a way to do so. And those that are evil in other ways will find a way to be aided by the religion. [5]

The first authorities [6] have said that one needs to combine faith and reason. The Lekutai Moharan (Volume 1, Chapter 1) also echoes this when it says that you need faith and wisdom. According to the Pardes, wisdom cannot refer to the Torah because the Torah is actually Binah in the clothing of Glory. This may be visualized as follows: one needs two sephirot revolving around each other to create radiation and to affect character.
