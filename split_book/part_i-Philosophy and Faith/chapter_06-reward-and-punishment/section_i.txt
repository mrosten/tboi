Doing the mitzvot physically only brings physical blessing as the Torah says, “I will give rain in its season”. Only doing the spiritual essence of the mitzvot brings spiritual blessing and enlightenment.

<blockquote class="fancy-quote">
“Blest are they whose days have not tasted of evil. For when a house hath once been shaken from heave, there the curse fails nevermore, passing from life to life… by folly in speech, and frenzy at the heart. Evil seems good to him whose mind the God draws to mischief; and but for the briefest space doth he fare free of woe.”
<br><strong>— Sophocles in Antigone</strong>

(i.e., any person with judgements upon them tends to do evil things almost against their will just so that the evil judgements will have something to come upon.)

<strong>Reincarnation of Roots</strong>
Rabbi Issac Luria says that the generations from Adam to Noah who were evil were reborn at the time of the flood to receive their punishment in this world. They were 600,000 root souls. The generations before the dispersion and the tower of Babylon were those same souls and had sinned during that ten-generation period. Similarly, the generations before the destruction of the 1st Temple.

And similarly, the generations before the Holocaust. And in the opinion of Rabbi Luria even if one was sinful in a prior life, once born again, he won't suffer for those sins if he lives properly. As the Zohar says about Job -- he wouldn't have suffered if he had brought peace offerings (parts of which are divided amongst the poor) instead of burnt offerings. This is even though he was Terach (who was an idolator) in a previous life. And that is why Rabbi Luria also says that he wouldn't have suffered if he had gone to Abraham to learn the ways of loving kindness. If we go by the opinion of Rabbi Luria, we will have to conclude that being religious isn't the same as being righteous for Job was religious, but he wasn't concerned enough about the poor to be righteous. In Hebrew, this is the difference between being righteous and being a saint.

If you knew all that you need then you wouldn't have free will. So, God makes sure you don't. Your true character can be revealed only when you don't know all the facts about your situation and how your actions affect events, and you must decide anyway how to act. But when one correctly knows the situation then he has no free will, and thus no reward and punishment and is just a clay in the hands of the artisan. But still the revealing of the traits doesn't happen in his way. And the free will was made for there to be the revealing of one's character traits. However even those totally in Yiddishkeit or Jesus or science, God seems to make sure that many things ever that are not known which can easily be seen by others so that there should still be free will in these things.

People's impression that big things happen in their lives because of very small things is true as the formula:

[IMAGE: image001.gif]

tells us, i.e., that a small variation between certain numbers can cause substantial changes. But eventually one comes down from the world of chaos into the world of probability where things average out into a nice binomial function - farther from the light but closer to the vessels that can hold whatever light one may have.

The reason there is suffering before each new level of wisdom is that the sephirot of Akudim before they reach a higher level must turn their backs to face upward, so the higher light comes through their backs. Then, as they reach the higher level, they turn around again to face forward to us and there is a higher revelation of light but during the time they were rising there was only the backward light (red shifted).

·

There have been people that accomplished great good in the world yet suffered enormously as a result of it. This is because the higher light comes dressed in judgements.
