Abraham gave to his seven children from the later wives “presents” and sent them to the East. I think this is the Vedic knowledge.

<div class="concept-box">
<strong>The Connection to the East</strong>
The Indus-Saraswati civilization had undergone decay from natural disasters. The arrival of the Vedic people around 1700-1500 BC right after the life of Abraham [which was at the beginning of the second millennium BC] was a rejuvenation — for they brought with them the teachings of Abraham.

This explains to me the fact of their strong monotheistic traditions though they still have idolatry and other dualistic traditions. I think this may explain from where they got the idea of meditation which I think is a well-established principle in all religious thought, yet clearly the East got it much before the West.

If it wasn't from Abraham, then clearly it must have been from some spiritual giant. Even Judaism today doesn't compare with it, for Judaism has become an anti­spiritual religion by its strictest adherents and obviously it must at least be able to lend itself to an anti-spiritual interpretation. While the Vedas are the most spiritual books that exist in terms of their search for enlightenment and not being able to take anything less as a substitute, even prayer, good deeds, study or even meditation. The Vedas can lend themselves to idolatry but certainly not to anti­spirituality.

One's place in the world is largely determined by the place one has in the large events of each of the ten sephirot. For, like in Math there is a constant progression upward and it is the job of the mathematician to add more bricks to the building of knowledge, not just to understand it, thus it is with all the ten sephirot. Thus:

<strong>Torah [Beauty]</strong>
Music [Judgment]
Mathematics
Philosophy
Politics

<strong>Advanced Math [Democracy]</strong>
Kabbalah
Romantic Calculus
Rational
The State

<strong>Gemarah</strong>
Classical Trigonometry
Aristotle
Feudalism

<strong>Mishna</strong>
Renaissance
Algebra
Plato
Empire

<strong>Bible</strong>
Medieval Geometry
Socrates
Monarchy

There are in each group [and there are many more groups] periods of blackholes when no progress is made. Sometimes progress is horizontal and sometimes it is vertical. Horizontal progress is also important since it adds to the base.
