            <h3>Section IX</h3>
            <p>Rabbi Issac Luria says that the generations from Adam to Noah were evil and so were reborn at the time of the flood to receive their punishment, in this world. Similarly, the generations before the dispersion and the tower of Babylon. Similarly, the generations before the destruction of the 1st Temple. And similarly, the generations before the Holocaust. The purpose of the creation of the world is the revelation of the oneness of God. This is accomplished by the trait of what one gives is what one gets. By the rewarding of good and truth and punishment of evil is revealed the oneness of God. This happens on every level, in every society, in every level of existence. This is the process of sifting out of the bad, and the bringing up of the good, in order to be included in the oneness of God.</p>
            <p>The idea of the creation of man is for someone for God to do good to. There was a basic lack in the divine traits before the world was created. This lack was not in the higher traits themselves but in the Royalty (the lowest) of the Infinite one, i.e., in the revelation of the traits. So, God had to create man in order to have someone to do good to: and the highest good is God himself. But, how can man have any connection with God himself!? So, God created Free Will, so that man could choose God — this by choosing good from evil — and thus have a connection with God — based on his own deeds and words, thoughts and desires — not based on a free hand-out. This is in itself on the level of Royalty, which needs to receive, and that was the problem in the 1st place. But now, man has united Royalty with the higher trait of giving, by choosing God, and not needing a free-handout to receive his reward of the light of God based upon his merits.</p>
