            <h3>Section II</h3>
            <p>God created free-will so man could choose God, this by choosing good from evil, and thus have a connection with God based on one's own deeds and words and thoughts and desire, and not based on a free handout. To receive via a free handout is from the level of royalty, whose nature is that it must receive. This is what the problem was in the very beginning. But now man has united Royalty with the higher trait represented by giving through choosing God and his reward of the light comes through his own merits. <sup>[10]</sup> From the idea that God fills all worlds and surrounds all worlds the idea becomes apparent that one must unite the sparks of holiness in everything with the infinite presence of God Himself by choosing God in everything he does, says, thinks, or desires, and thus uniting himself and all creation with God. When one is united with God then he too can create Godliness. This is indeed the 1st commandment in the Torah — to be fruitful and multiply, i.e., in children and ideas, and music.</p>
            <p>Pleasure is on the level of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and therefore not good or bad in itself but dependent on what one uses it for. If one brings up the sparks of holiness in that pleasure into holiness, he himself goes up and the evil falls. Just saying a blessing has nothing to do with this. It depends a lot on how he raises the children. If it's food it depends on what one does with the energy. Pleasure for the sake of pleasure remains on the original level and it falls into evil and becomes evil itself. Pleasure however for the sake of God and done with attachment to God is like a sacrifice, and is on a very holy level.</p>
            <p>Allowing free thought is important for ideas need room to flow, and when restricted like in a constricted vessel, they cannot. Similarly, logic, in its purest form, also limits free thought. Revelation also limits free thought -- there are things beyond the comprehension of the mind that only revelation can reveal. So, reason and revelation are the two outer vessels that contain free thought; they correspond to Chaya and Yechida.</p>
