            <p>People however do differ in their tendencies based on their DNA structure so there definitely is an effect on people by being born Jewish, but it isn't the same as when the actual soul is Jewish - which is independent of how one was born.] It's interesting to notice that the Rambam places philosophers and scientists on a higher spiritual plane than people who know the whole Talmud and keep all the commandments of the Torah. I however divide people according to their character traits: v The Artist v The Scientist-Philosopher v The Religious Scholar v The Business Man (normally religious) v The Leach.</p>
            <p>But in reality, this is the same as the Rambam as Bertrand Russell explained. The Artist is the Prophet. Each should have the same focal point -- the King. Those that face the opposite direction have negative of their absolute value. If facing sideways their value is (R)</p>

            <p>(Cosine of the angle between them and the King). If they oscillate, they give out a wave pattern. The waves sometimes constructively interfere and sometimes not. But you can get an average value, which is the reason democracies work decently if at least they are facing the King While monarchies only work well if the monarch is facing the King. That's why the Torah stipulates that the prophet has to choose the King or at least the Sanhedrin, who should be hopefully somewhat intelligent and therefore should make a halfway decent choice. (The main job of the Torah King was mainly military, so his power was limited. But still it had a big effect on the people who their king was).</p>
            <p>In conclusion, we can't divide people by religion because it is almost irrelevant to their character, which to all the major religions is the main thing, and the main path to God. Rather the main dividing line is the thinkers and the masses. However, this has nothing to do with intelligence for an unintelligent person can be a deep and profound thinker, while a brilliant mind can be shallow, trivial, and of no concern to anyone (i.e., non-fruitful).</p>
