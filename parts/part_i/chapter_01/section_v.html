            <h3>Section V</h3>
            <p>Idea - Flux of Secular/Religious Litvak/Chasid The idea that nothing exists besides God is on the level of, "He surrounds all worlds", i.e., the circular sephirot. But on the level of the straight sephirot, in which God fills all worlds, His life energy is divided among the different levels that exist in the order of creation. That is, even though his infinite light is everywhere and nothing exists besides It, It is not manifest in the individual creations. The light that is manifest in individual creations is divided by level.</p>
            <p>So there are the sparks of holiness in everything, which keep those things existing on a manifest level. Then, there is the life force and particular holiness inside ideas and spirit, which keep those things existing, and gives to them their individual character. When one concentrates on the idea of their existing, nothing exists besides God, that is when the idea has the most power. Just as matter cannot curve space unless it is in a concentrated area, in the same way, this thought cannot draw the light of God unless one really works at it. <sup>[3]</sup></p>
            
            <hr class='divider'> <div class='footnotes'> <p class='footnote-item'><sup>[3]</sup> However the son of the Baal Ha  Tanya said that one still needs to draw the light into the knowledge of the  vessels (i.e., by the learning of the Eitz Chayim) otherwise the light just  breaks  one's  vessels.</p> </div>
