            <h3>Section II</h3>
            <p>There is no question that you can take any statement of the Talmud or its commentators and argue it pro and con ad infinitum. The question is as to the fruitfulness of this. The point is, no matter how far you go its only horizontal depth. The formulas of halacha result in an infinity of variations because of the slight variations of the parameters of each person's individual soul and world-line. When we don't know how to keep the commandments we are to go to the Jewish Sages (Deuteronomy 17:8-13); and that is the Talmud, which is the generality of the Oral law. However, the laws which they made to guard Biblical laws because of a specific situation which existed at that time or place, those laws don't apply in the opinion of the Rashbam and Raavad — when the reason for the law disappears so does the law. To the Rosh even, if the reason applies, if it's not in the same place where the law was originally made it doesn't apply. [The importance of not adding on any restrictions is to keep the patterns of chaos of each person's soul which comes from the circular sephirot and provides the energy of serving God.] Without the ideas of the science of Chaos, it is hard to understand why the Torah commands us not to add to the commandments.</p>
            <p>The laws of the written Torah are invariant. But the Jewish people are in an inertial frame of reference as compared to Mount Sinai, so all explanations which are direct traditions from Sinai always apply to them but not to non-Jews who are in an accelerating frame revolving around the empty space. Different formulations apply to them. Now even in the written Torah many laws are given that apply only in Israel like a gas that obeys the gas laws when it is in a state of equilibrium. When not in that state the only way to describe [until now] is by statistical methods. That is why since the laws of the Torah are statistically valid, but in cases keeping the law would invalidate its purpose to Rabbi Shimon, the law doesn't apply. Perhaps Solomon’s mistake was that there was a state of equilibrium in his days.</p>
            <p>Many of the laws of the Torah are based on probability, e.g., the majority of judges in civil cases, and majority opinion in religious cases. It's OK if the Torah has statistical laws because probability is part of the fabric of the spiritual and physical universe. Before the case comes to court it's a wave pattern where all the facts co-exist in mathematical wave form. But once it's in court the facts are observed and reduced to particle form. [The majority of Rabbi Nachman's advice is in fact statistical, not absolute. He simply describes the forces at work in each mitzvah but the actual effects in each person's life will be based on many factors. Like wearing tzitzis saving one from bad advice. It can cause one to get bad advice also by getting involved with religious hypocrites. However, Rabbi Nachman is referring to some degree of a spiritual effect that the tzitzis do have.] Not every <em>Kal Vechomer</em> (a conclusion from a minority) is a law to Moses on Mount Sinai, but it is from heaven as is everything which comes from the 13 ways to explain the Torah, (as the Rambam says in <em>Moreh Nevuchim</em>), for there are many places in the Talmud where how to apply any one of the 13-principles is a subject of debate (i.e. if you can prove a law from one of the 13 principles then it is Biblical).</p>
            <p>The Gemarah in Sanhedrin (99a) states:</p>
            <blockquote class="fancy-quote">
            <p>“Even if one says the whole Torah is from Heaven except for one verse that God didn't say rather Moses said it himself is in the category of ‘he has despised the word of the Lord’... and even if he says the whole Torah is from heaven except for some derivation or some a conclusion a minority or some derivation from similar expressions is in the category of ‘he has despised the Word of the Lord’.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>If this would mean every time a derivation is said in the Gemarah that it was said to Moses at Mount Sinai then all the Talmudic sages would be in that category, for the Talmud is full of arguments on the application of the 13 principles. Rather this means that anything proven by the 13 principles is from heaven, not that it's a tradition from Moses on Mount Sinai. [On Biblical verses the Gemarah says God said them to Moses, but on derivations it says they are from heaven.] There was disagreement between the halachic authorities and the kabbalists that was very strong in the Middle Ages. This continues in every generation for the rabbis continue to disagree with the cabalists of their generation while only agreeing with the ones that have gone, like the war the rabbis made against Rabbi Chayim Lutzato and against the Baal Shem Tov and Rabbi Nachman and Rabbi Abulafia. This was a continuation of the disagreements in philosophy between the ultra-orthodox Pharisees and the esoteric Essences. The root of this starts from Joseph (who was on the level of the inner truth) and his brothers.</p>
            <p>The outer truth is the halacha. The inner truth is the Kabbalah. Only afterwards the rabbis incorporated the Braitot of the Essences in the Mishna and Talmud and accepted all the later Kabbalists while finding new ones to make war on.</p>
