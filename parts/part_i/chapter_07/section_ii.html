            <h3>Section II</h3>
            <p>In the 1960's there existed the wisdom to understand that the establishment needed to be either reformed or thrown out (that's the disagreement between “The Greening of America” and Ayn Rand. But there was also in the air the rebellion against parents. This danger doesn't exist now because in the air there is all the talk about strengthening the family. But this talk didn't exist then. The children of today's children will have the same test since time is circular. How can we make sure the coming 1960s will not decay into the yuppie 1970's? and not be a rebellion against all moral values, rather than just against false ones. The answer is the basis (religion) must be strong- but not fanatical; just solid. We need a religious and philosophic basis for the world. That is knowledge of the Bible and the Talmud and the great philosophers, and religious giants of history like Buddha, the Gita, Jesus, Rabbi Nachman, etc. We need to bring the Bible back to the world.</p>
            <p>The problem with the hippies was that they needed to provide a viable alternative to the establishment, which really doesn't exist. Their economic ideal of communism has shown itself to be a non-workable option. Their major benefit was to shake things up so that reform within the system could take place, which wouldn't have happened without them. They made the reduction of the cold war to be the goal. Although President Reagan accomplished it in a way they would not have agreed with; but at least it stopped. Without that the world would at some point been destroyed a couple times over. They accomplished reform in education so that the education of the 60s was individually oriented.</p>
            <p>At the time of the destruction of the first Temple, the secrets of the Torah went into exile and were scattered all over the world. That is why Pythagoras, Buddha, Plato, Socrates and so many other spiritual and intellectual giants appeared on the scene at that point.</p>
            <div class="concept-box">
            <p><strong>The Two Protagonists</strong> There have to be two protagonists in every generation, each correct and true - but from the opposing worlds of Chaos and Correction, and therefore in conflict with each other: <ul> <li>Einstein and Heisenberg</li> <li>The Baal Shem Tov and the Gra</li> <li>Dr. Spock and Dr Vincent Peal (The Power of positive Thinking)</li> <li>Plato and Aristotle</li> <li>Hillel and Shamai</li> </ul> But this is only after the house of King David was split for before that there was power in the righteous [tikun the sephirot of correction] to contain the two opposites [i.e., the light of correction and of chaos, freedom].</p>
            </div>
            <p>The Talmud says that in the year 6000 (2240 in the English calendar) God will destroy the world, people will fly on wings 1000 years and then in the year 7000 there will be the revival of the dead and a renewal of this world. Perhaps the wings the Talmud refers to are spacecraft? [Is it possible we will live on other planets? I have heard that perhaps travel faster than light is possible if done like the traveling of energy in a rope that isn’t shaken up and down so that the energy travels in waves but rather pulled so that the energy travels in a faster way.] People haven't traveled back to us in time yet because to the Shemita opinion time comes in layers and the future layers haven't come yet into existence (the future doesn't yet exist.) Mankind goes through harmonic motion (something like</p>
            <div class='image-container'><img src='../../../images/image002.gif' alt='Book Image' class='book-image'></div>
            <p>). Similarly, each nation and individual. That is why this century has had accelerated harmonic motion with the progress of democracy and freedom; yet also world wars and depressions. I would suggest that A isn't a constant but gets smaller with time, so the harmonic motion gets more accentuated. I don't think accepting Jesus would have saved the Jewish nation at the second Temple period because if so, it should have done so for the Roman empire 300 years later. Yet we see the Roman Empire disintegrated into nothing starting immediately after they accepted Jesus. Thus, it seems to me that the events surrounding Jesus were as planned. According to the translation of Wise and Eisen that is in fact exactly what the prophet Isaiah if fact predicted. But it is likely that the destruction would have taken a less violent turn - as with the Romans the destruction of the nation meant dissolving the political unity, not the mass destruction of the people as it did for the Jewish people at the time of the destruction of the Temple.</p>
            <p>If we go by Hegel’s idea of religion and philosophy, I think we should be entering on a new age of religion that will be an improvement from the last ages for this coming one will include each religion retaining its identity yet integrating the good aspects of others.</p>
