            <p>“Not only the body, but also the soul whose habits, tempers, opinions, desires, pleasures, fears never remain the same… and this is equally true of knowledge… not only do the sciences in general spring up and decay… but each of them individually experiences a like change.” <br><strong>— Plato Symposium</strong></p>

            <p><strong>The Direction of History</strong> MANKIND PROGRESSED DOWNWARD THROUGH TIME. UNTIL JESUS WAS HIT AT THE ORIGIN. Then we came out to the other side continuing in the same direction but now progressing towards the light instead of away.</p>
            </div>
            <p>“At the time of dusk there will be light.” The Zohar explained that this refers to the 272 years before the 6th millennium of the Hebrew calendar which comes out to be the year 1968. During the 6th 1000-year period there was a flow on the level of Foundation which is from 1240 until 2240. (3760 B.C. is the beginning of the 1st thousand.) This would explain the flow of wisdom since then. And the Rambam's saying in the letter to Yemen that prophesy would start then. This is leading up to the 7th thousand-year period starting 2240. This is similar to the 1st thousand were to draw from the previous “Sabbath” on thousand years while our period is to draw from the coming thousand-year period.</p>
            <p>• Every hundred years is a blessing in a different field as a part of the process of the redemption of mankind. ● 1400-1500 was art. ● From 1500 to 1600 was the Reformation. ● From 1600 to 1700 was Mathematics Philosophy. ● From 1700 - 1800 was Music. ● From 1850 - 1950 was invention. ● 1900 - 2000 was Physics. [an art-religion-science -philosophy cycle.] This doesn't mean that at the end of the period the blessing has to stop. It can continue but not in the same way as a massive overflowing. This refers to the circular sephirot of the non-Jews whose spiritual redemption started from Jesus. But the Jewish hundred-year periods start on the forty-year mark.</p>
            <p>Thus: · 1240-1340 - Royalty - [the writings of Abulafia and the other Kabbalists]. · 1340-1440 - Foundation. · 1440-1540 - Splendor - which is a time of judgement and thus was the expulsion from Spain. · 1540-1640 – Victory – Kabbalah - Rabbi Issac Ashkenazi and Spinoza who proved God and discovered the logical proofs of the system of the Torah. (However, since he was excommunicated, it hasn't been used as such). · 1640-1740 Torah-Beauty - The Ramchal, the Gra and the Baal Shem Tov, Rabbi Yaakov Abuchatzera and Rabbi Shalom Sharabi - all the sages of Torah that all Torah (learning and keeping) until today is based on.</p>
            <p>· 1740-1840 – Judgement - the fall of the Jewish people away from the Torah yet still there was the counter force of Rabbi Nachman and the other great sages that continued the different movements mentioned above. · 1840-1940 – Kindness - return to Israel (Royalty) and emigration to America (Foundation). · 1940-2040 - Understanding - This implies the awakening of judgements (the Holocaust), freedom [i.e., the 1960s], and Understanding itself. · 2040-3040 - Wisdom. · 3040-4040 - Crown. [The implication of all this is that World War III should start around 2010 which is Understanding of Understanding.]</p>
