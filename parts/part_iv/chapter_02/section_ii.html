            <p>imagine that the universe does form a loop and though gravity doesn't form loops on a small scale perhaps it does on a large scale. Perhaps this could explain the fact that the galaxies don't fly apart. If gravity is in fact like the electromagnetic force, if it would change over the course of time, you would get its counterpart. Now any accelerating system like the earth and the sun [or the galaxy] is changing over time, so perhaps this system is emitting some other type of waves besides gravitational waves. Yet since the density of the galaxy is so small, we just don't notice it.</p>
            <p>The light of the sephirot isn't all the same, but the light of 52 is a spiritual-electric field and the light of 45 is a magnetic field and together they create a spiritual electromagnetic wave by the oscillation of the name 52 at the top of the empty space.</p>

            <p>because speed is a measure of space-time like length is a measure of space. So, the force that turns energy to matter is an inverse square force. (So, if c was a variable, the less it would be, the more mass you would have, so c 2 takes the place of r 2 in a higher realm. But what would come after that a 2 , the acceleration of light? And after that, I guess, would be the change in the acceleration with respect to time, and so for every dimension up you add. Current is described by a differential equation that has a solution only with a complex number. Perhaps that is because mass has a complex part of itself as in</p>
